# Loftware Code of Conduct

The Loftware project is committed to creating Swift libraries of the highest
quality. To do that, we need people of the highest quality. We firmly beileve
that welcoming all contributors is essential to that mission and to that
effect, we require all members of our community to abide by the following code
of conduct.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback in a way that
  encourages rather than discourages further contribution.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Reviewer Responsibilities

Much of the work relating to the Loftware project is related to code review,
and API refinement.

As a part of this process, constructive criticism is **required**. It is
therefore important that contributors work to provide feedback in a welcoming
and encouraging manner.

Individuals found to be in violation of Reviewer Responsibilites, but who do
not violate our base community standards, will be asked to amend their
feedback, and change their behavior going forward. Repeated violations of
Reviewer Responsibilities are considered violations of community standards and
will be enforced as such.

A good rule of thumb for identifying if your feedback abides by the reviewer
responsibilities is: "Have you highlighted clear, actionable solutions to
provided criticism, or furthered discussion in an encouraging manner?" Some
common ways in which feedback can be discouraging include the following
(among others):

### Ad Hominem Criticism

Ad hominem criticism is defined as attacking a contributor themselves rather
than critiquing their work product. For example:

> You must be new here, I would never write something like this.

> No offense, but I can't think of any reason why you would even try to go
> about this like that.

### Non Constructive Criticism

Non constructive criticism consists of pointing out flaws while providing no
discussion of opportunities for improvement. It strongly discourages potential
new community members as it provides no room for growth, only punishment for
making an attempt. For example:

> This code is bad. It probably needs to be rewritten from scratch.

> The code style throughout this whole pull request is wrong.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with

permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
